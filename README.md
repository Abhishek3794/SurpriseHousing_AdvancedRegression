## General Information
- A housing company purchases houses at a lower price and then sells them at a profit.

- The data used for this predictive modelling assignment contains the hosuing data for the Australian market.



## Problem Statement
- ***Surprise Housing***, a US-based housing company wants to ented the Australian market. The company uses data analaytics to purchase houses at a lower price and then sells them at a profit. For this, the compnay requires a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Technologies Used
- ***Python*** - version ***3.x***
- ***pandas*** - version ***1.4.2***
- ***numpy*** - version ***1.21.5***
- ***matplotlib*** - version ***3.5.1***
- ***seaborn*** - version ***0.11.2***

## Conclusions
- ***Most significant features*** - The ___OverallQual__, ___GrLivArea___, ___TotalBsmtSF___ and ___SaleCondition___ are the most significant features in explaining the changes in the demand for the shared bike service.

- ***OverallQual*** - The prices of the houses increased with increase in overall quality. This was the most important feature.

- ***GrLivArea*** - The prices of the houses increased with increase in living area above the ground. This was the second most important fature.

- ***TotalBsmtSF*** - The prices of the houses increased with increase in total basement area.

- ***SaleCondition*** - The prices varied with th condition of sale significantly.
